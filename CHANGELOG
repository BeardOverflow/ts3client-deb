=== Client Release 3.1.5 20 Jul 2017
! This is the last release with support for Windows Vista
+ Added possibility to overwrite Qt style icons with custom iconpacks
+ Added tooltips over client and channel items in server tree
+ Added support for SVG Tiny 1.2 (static only, no animations) icons. Most 
  icons are no longer hardcoded to fixed size 16x16.
+ Replaced included default_mono and default_colored iconpacks with SVG icons.
  Iconpacks with PNG icons are still supported, so existing third-party
  iconpacks continue to work. We encourage third-party iconpack authors to
  update their iconpacks with SVG icons.
+ Overhauled icons in most windows for improved support for high dpi monitors.
* Updated Qt to 5.6.2 on Windows and macOS
* Updated Visual Studio C++ runtime on Windows to 14.0.24215 (MSVC 2015-3)
* New default style for infoframe based on "Improved Default" by Sven Paulsen.
* Removed old default/modern/classic styles.
* Rewrote translation mechanism for infoframe styles. Translations now come
  from lagos_xx.qm and are filled by C++, so multiple language templates are
  no longer necessary. However, for legacy style support, language templates
  will be loaded with priority. So if e.g. clientinfo_de.tpl exists, it will
  be used. If not, clientinfo.tpl is loaded, which should contain the new
  translatable placeholders.
* Updater no longer downloads banner from server, banner is now hardcoded in
  executable. Dynamic banners currently not needed.

  to 3.1.5 client. 3.1.4 might have downloaded SVGs which it cannot use, which
  caused creation of an empty icon file.
- Fixed package installer crash on Windows 32-bit OS.
- Fixed length check in various nickname input fields. Trim whitespaces before
  calculating length when doing validity checks.
- Added bandaids for misbehaving audio drivers on Windows

* Various improvements to Overwolf integration.
* Minor update to license agreement logic to avoid showing a new license text
  when users are not required to re-accept the license.
* Windows Audio Session (WASAPI) sound backend improvements.
* Readded possibility to use ts3server links with token and addbookmark
  parameters, which got lost with sync changes in 3.1. Instead of storing a
  token in the bookmark as pre-3.1, the token is locally stored in a file
  and used the first time a connection is established via the added bookmark.
  Such tokens will not be synchronized via myTeamSpeak.
- Improved text in error reporter to make more clear what we are going to
  upload.
- Updated some permission help texts

  + New Plugin API to allow plugins to "provide" new hotkey input
  + Mouse Button 4 and 5 support on Linux
  + Improved cross-platform keyboard key mapping to better handle keys 
    on non US keyboards
  - Fixed a bug that would cause the client to lose the ability 
    to handle hotkeys on Mac after an update using the built-in updater
  ! Hotkeys created using Client 3.1.1 are not compatible with 3.1.0.1 or below
  ! Moved Gamepad and Joystick support from the client to a plugin. This plugin
    is available in myTeamSpeak and will be automatically installed.
+ Improvements to Windows Audio Session sound backend
* Added some informative tooltips and dialogs to myTeamSpeak dialogs, trying to
  explain what "Stay logged in on this computer" and "Synchronization" features
  do, as this apparently caused some user confusion.
* Changed behavior in myTeamSpeak options page. Apply settings immediately
  instead of waiting for Apply/Ok click.

- Fixed server- and clientlog filter list breaking on entries including
  linebreaks.

=== Client Release 3.1 15 Dec 2016
+ Added support for myTeamSpeak. Signing up for a myTeamSpeak account will
  allow you to synchronize your bookmarks, identities, hotkeys, whisper lists
  and channel subscriptions. Upcoming myTeamSpeak features will include addons
  synchronization, addons update management, and more.
+ Added IPv6 support
+ Filetransfer backend rewritten
+ New improved echo cancellation implementation
+ Addons now install into user directory by default, where no UAC is required
  unless using a portable installation.
+ All backend for bookmarks, identities, hotkeys, whisperlists, subscriptions,
  addons etc. rewritten, using new storage system across all devices.
+ New implementation of TSDNS. Important change: The client now only looks for
  a TSDNS server on a toplevel SRV record. For server name a.b.c.d.e the client
  will only search for a TSDNS server with a SRV record named _tsdns._tcp.d.e
+ Added russian and japanese translations.
+ Upgraded C++ runtime to Visual Studio 2015. Added support to install the
  Microsoft C++ runtime package on demand during update process.
+ Added whisperlist import/export to textfile, see contextmenu on the
  synchronized/local lists in whisperlists dialog. Requested by users for
  easier sharing of complex whisperlist setups.

  of these badges should be shown in the client. See Options / MyTeamSpeak page
+ Added -safemode commandline parameter to skip loading any plugins.
+ Added check for injected Ad-Aware dll which may crash the TeamSpeak client.
! In recent OS X versions, hotkeys may stop working after using the built-in
  updater. When installing from a disk image, they work fine. We are currently
  evaluating this issue.
  If you are an OS X user and require hotkeys, consider using the disk image
  installer instead of the updater.
! TSDNS now uses the list https://publicsuffix.org/list/public_suffix_list.dat
  to determine at what level the client should query for a TSDNS server. It
  will pick the domain 1 level below the domains on that list. For example: for
  a.b.c.co.uk it will pick c.co.uk since co.uk is on that list.
* Do not consider a teredo tunnel as a routable ipv6 address. If there is no
  other routable ipv6 address, this means the client will not try to resolve
  ipv6 addresses.
* Submenus temporarily removed from Self menu on OS X until we find a
  workaround for Qt 5.6.1 issue with submenus not updating properly.
* Overhauled Windows sound backend.
* Plugins can now load dynamic libraries from a subfolder with same name as
  plugin library (Windows only).
- Added missing 16x16_myts_account.png to "Origin" iconpack (gfx/default.zip)

  forum. In case of a crash, a report tool will show and ask the user if the
  dump should automatically be uploaded to our servers.
+ Collect and send anonymous statistics about users hardware and operating
  system to us for internal decisions (which hardware and OS version needs to
  be supported etc.). Disabled by default, user will be asked by a dialog the
  first time if he agrees to send the data. Decision can be changed later in
  Options/Application/Anonymous Statistics. What exactly is being sent is
  displayed in the client log. If agreed, data is sent once per month. Users on

=== Client Release 3.0.15 23 Jun 2014
+ Overhauled update system. General goals are to reduce download size and allow
  the updater to update itself before updating the client.
+ Two-step update ensures that the updater can update itself before updating
  the TeamSpeak client. This way we can deploy changes to the updater more 
  quickly.
+ Updater copies itself to temp folder and then runs from there, thus we no
  longer have issues with the updater not being able to update files because they
  are currently used by the system.
+ Added binary patching to the updater for a faster and much smaller download
+ Compressed update files with lzma instead of gzip to further reduce size
+ Added update channel selection to Options dialog (Applications page) to make
  it easier to switch to beta channel. No more update.ini editing required.
+ URLs will now be written into their own database named urls.db. The old urls.dat
  will be converted and deleted. If the converter finds a broken url in the
  urls.dat, the file will be discarded and a clean database will be created.
* Simplified Updater UI, removed some useless functions (Start/Changelog)
* Updated bundled Overwolf installer
* Multiple fixes and improvements to bbCode parser from 3.0.14.
* Updated openssl to 1.0.1h

  our downloads page (http://teamspeak.com?page=downloads).
- Removed mirrors.ini, mirrors are no longer being used.
- Fixed broken date and time displays (bans, temp passwords, messages, logs
  etc). This was an oversight when switching from Qt 4 to 5.
- Fixed currently typing pen in chat not showing to other users.
- Fixed delay after applying changes in some pages of the Options dialog,
  especially noticeable in Applications page.
- Fixed adding bans not working with some Unicode characters in nicknames.

=== Client Release 3.0.14 14 Mar 2014
+ Updated to Qt 5.2.1. Updated compilers, runtime and third party libraries.
  This includes a multitude of changes to the TeamSpeak client to ensure
  transition from Qt 4 to 5. This is a major update under the hood.
+ Iconpacks can now be provided as a zip file. See gfx/default.zip
  Old folders gfx/default and gfx/countries will be emptied on update.
  Custom iconpacks are still supported. Icons in extracted folders take
  priority over zip archives if both exist.
  Note: Plugin authors have to provide their own icons.
+ The plugin SDK is now distributed as zip archive in pluginsdk.zip. The old
  pluginsdk folder is no longer updated, original files will be automatically
  deleted on update.
+ Added https support, so the client can now load and display remote icons from
  https pages. A https server banner will work after the next server release.
* Distribute Windows runtime as DLLs in TeamSpeak installation root instead of
  using vcredist package. This is a temporary solution until the updater is
  able to run a downloaded vcredist package post-update if required.
* Unused Qt 4 libraries will be deleted by the updater when the updater starts
  (so not immediately on first update, as the old updater still requires Qt 4).
* Memory usage and overall performance optimizations.
* Plugin API increased to 20. Plugins depending on Qt 4.8 have to be updated.
* Plugin API: Added isDown parameter to requestHotkeyInputDialog function to
  support PTT key bindings. Note: It's in the pluginsdk.zip now!
* Prevent client from connecting to ports > 65535.
* Missing icons will be shown as a blue bordered icon with a number.
* Inform users when a recording client joins or leaves your channel.
* Permissions window allows to set b_channel_join_ignore_password for server
  groups, channel groups and clients.
* "Install Overwolf" checkbox in Windows is now remotely controlled by Overwolf
  server. If down or not reachable, defaults to disabled.
* Cache animated avatars/banners to lower hard disk access.
* On Linux the system tray icon is now hidden by default due to incompatibilities
  with Qt and freedesktop tray icon standards. It can be activated in the
  options.
* Privilege key window supports Multi-select for copy to clipboard action.
* Improved integration with Overwolf for their latest 2014-02-03 release.
* Moved chat format buttons from mainwindow into the chat input contextmenu.
  These actions will now add bbCode tags to the text instead of using a very
  basic WYSIWYG approach, which is too dependant on Qt CSS formatting risking
  to break on any Qt update.
* Automatically format *bold* and _underline_ in received chat messages.
- Fixed joystick/gamepad button count.
- Fixed renaming profiles.
- Fixed saving preset messages.
- Removed "Hide in taskbar" option
- Removed "Use double click to activate" option, tray icon activation is now
  using the platform standard behavior (double click on Windows, single click
  on other platforms)

=== Client Release 3.0.13 01 Oct 2013
+ Added support for channel delay feature in server 3.0.10. This allows to set
  a delay in seconds after which temporary channels will be deleted after the
  last client has left. To configure a virtualserver default, set the delay in
  the virtualserver edit dialog. Or configure per channel in the channel edit
  dialog. Channel templates were adjusted to show the delete delay and a count-
  down until the channel is removed.

  autoupdate and installer, which downloads the actual Overwolf installer.

  running Overwolf (can be disabled in Options/Design). These icons require
  TeamSpeak Server 3.0.9 or later.

  possibility to control TeamSpeak from another application running on the same
  computer, similar to the clientquery plugin. Currently Windows only. More
  detailed information will be available in the near future.

  updates to the overlay plugin no longer depend on a TeamSpeak release. The
  overlay plugin is available and maintained on the authors webpage:
  http://ts3overlay.r-dev.de/
* Direct Input Hotkey is now automatically changed to "Default" in preparation
  to removing Direct Input in a later release. While you can manually switch it

  with plugins to associate server errors with ts3 function calls from
  individual plugins. See the test plugin for implementation details.

  "blocked_user" instead of "foe" for consistency reasons.
! The maximum amount of simultaneous tranfers is now 10 (5 upload/5 download).

  updating the info area of the specified item if this is the currently
  displayed item in the info area.

  channel to inform the user how to request talk power.
+ Added links to add-ons webpage to multiple places in the client.

  extracted to the new config file at client startup and only accessed there.
  This makes it easier to share hotkey configurations.

+ Added a message popup when server update is available but server hasn't been
  updated for at least seven days.

  b_client_permissionoverview_own or b_client_permissionoverview_view for own
  client and b_client_permissionoverview_view for other clients.
* Permission overview now shows grant permission in a new column of the
  corresponding permission instead of an own line.
* The search field in the "All clients" dialog now searches directly on the
  server instead of the local results. So no need to hit "More" multiple times
  until all clients are received before searching anymore.
* When uploading/downloading an existing file, the dialog shows filesize and
  file creationdate.
* Permission filter text and state of the granted-only checkbox are now saved

  channels are automatically subscribed.

  same logfile.

  is not available from the outside like desktop, explorer etc. Inside the
  filebrowser, items can still be dropped to root or the according levels up.

  dialog occuring when a client is unknown on this server.
